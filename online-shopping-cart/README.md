Step 1: Build the ItemToPurchase class with the following specifications:
    Attributes
    item_name (string)
    item_price (float)
    item_quantity (int)
    Default constructor
    Initializes item's name = "none", item's price = 0, item's quantity = 0
    Method
    print_item_cost()

Example of print_item_cost() output:
Bottled Water 10 @ $1 = $10

Step 2: In the main section of your code, prompt the user for items and create objects of the ItemToPurchase class.

Step 3: Add the costs of the two items together and output the total cost.


TOTAL COST
Chocolate Chips 1 @ $3 = $3
Bottled Water 10 @ $1 = $10
Total: $13
